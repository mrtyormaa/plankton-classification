3,20151018,"Add a new feature - Failure","Goal : To add a (random) feature to the application.
 
Procedure : 
1. Created a new vector of features.
2. Added the feature eccentricity to it.
3. Added to the Random Forest.
4. Tested results
Results :
1. The application executed successfully.
2. This experiment was a failure as the runtime of the application increased significantly.
3. Came to the conclusion that this is not the right approach. Instead of creating a new vector, it is better to append to the existing feature vector.
