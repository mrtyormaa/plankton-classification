Procedure :
An image texture is a set of metrics calculated in image processing designed to quantify the perceived texture of an image. Image texture gives us information about the spatial arrangement of color or intensities in an image or selected region of an image.
Image textures can be artificially created or found in natural scenes captured in an image. Image textures are one way that can be used to help in segmentation or classification of images. To analyze an image texture in computer graphics, there are two ways to approach the issue: Structured Approach and Statistical Approach.
Results :
The tradeoff was not worth it. I had to add 52 columns to the feature matrix. But this resulted only in a slight increase of efficiency by 0.2%. Hence, this feature will be excluded fromt the final application.",Fail,20151024-def912c646fcb4d51b8e923c845ab8ec30af6043,https://localhost:443/elabftw/experiments.php?mode=view&id=13
