Procedure :
 Local binary patterns (LBP) is a type of feature used for classification in computer vision. LBP is the particular case of the Texture Spectrum model. 
The LBP feature vector, in its simplest form, is created in the following manner:

Divide the examined window into cells (e.g. 16x16 pixels for each cell).
For each pixel in a cell, compare the pixel to each of its 8 neighbors (on its left-top, left-middle, left-bottom, right-top, etc.). Follow the pixels along a circle, i.e. clockwise or counter-clockwise.
Where the center pixel's value is greater than the neighbor's value, write ""1"". Otherwise, write ""0"". This gives an 8-digit binary number (which is usually converted to decimal for convenience).
Compute the histogram, over the cell, of the frequency of each ""number"" occurring (i.e., each combination of which pixels are smaller and which are greater than the center).
Optionally normalize the histogram.
Concatenate (normalized) histograms of all cells. This gives the feature vector for the window

Hence, this might be a very successful feature for further classification.
Results :
 This was a huge success. I got an improvement of 1% by addition of one metric. The final efficiency of the system at present lies at 49%.",Success,20151024-c5307ef94f9d3afff3dc8a7259beab4cd1de5211,https://localhost:443/elabftw/experiments.php?mode=view&id=11
